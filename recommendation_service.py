 Project: OrderSense
 Author: Arsh Deep Singh
 Description:
     Core recommendation engine for OrderSense â€” converts AI-based demand 
     forecasts into actionable reorder quantities per product.

 Implementation Notes:
     - This is a fully functional **MVP-level implementation**, not a scaffold.
     - It performs real calculations on forecasted demand, lead time, and
       safety stock to produce reorder recommendations.
     - The logic is production-aligned but not yet production-hardened.
       (No dynamic business rules, live inventory sync, or advanced confidence 
       weighting implemented yet.)

 Processing Flow:
     1. Retrieve all products from the database.
     2. For each product, aggregate its forecasted demand (from Prophet output).
     3. Apply a fixed 10% safety stock buffer and adjust for lead time.
     4. Derive reorder quantity and compute confidence averages.
     5. Persist recommendations to the database and return summarized JSON.

 Current Level:
     âœ… Functional Implementation (Validated End-to-End)
     ðŸš§ Ready for future hardening and optimization.

 Future Improvements:
     - Category-specific safety stock percentages.
     - Dynamic reorder policy tuning via configuration.
     - Real-time inventory integration.
     - Explainability layer (variance analysis, model traceability).
     - Alerting and audit logging for generated recommendations.
